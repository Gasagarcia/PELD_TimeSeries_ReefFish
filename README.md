# PELD_TimeSeries_ReefFish
Workflow used to analyze the reef fish monitoring data recorded by PELD-ILOC in four Brazilian Oceanic Islands.
PELD (Programa de Pesquisas Ecológicas de Longa Duração) is a Brazilian government funded initiative to install long term monitoring programs across Brazilian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This project concerns the reef fish monitoring data derived from oceanic islands (ILOC, from portuguese for Ilhas Oceânicas) monitored in the Central and Western Atlantic under Brazilian territorial jurisdiction.
This project shares code and data used to describe reef fish data gathered by the PELD-ILOC project and enhanced by associated researchers. The data used here is currently under possession of the ReefSyn working group and is available in the DarwinCore format at the GBIF repository: https://doi.org/10.25607/rov4or.
Here, I provide the old, discontinued data structure formerly used due to compatibility issues. I strongly advice not using this older version as it (1) does not account for taxonomic updates in species name and (2) was not curated for potential human errors. I include some corrections and taxonomic updates in my scripts, but the changes I made are restricted to the most common species subset that fit in our criteria of abundance, persistence and minimal sampling effort.
